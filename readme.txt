Check the comment for a set maximum length and disapprove it if it's too long.

== Description ==

For some wordpress themes it is very useful to limit comments to a certain amount of characters. Wordpress does not offer such an ability therefore I wrote this small plugin to limit the length of the comments.  

Based on:
* [Minimum Comment Length](http://yoast.com/wordpress/minimum-comment-length/).

== Installation ==

Installation is easy:

* Download the plugin.
* Copy the folder `maximum-comment-length` to the plugins directory of your blog.
* Enable the plugin in your admin panel.

Optional:

* An options panel will appear under Options.
* Decide on which comment length you'd like to block and what error to throw when a comment is too long.
